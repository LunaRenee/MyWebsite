        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I love cats, tacos, and Jeremy Renner. <br/>
            I am from Chicago, IL and grew up in the country. A small town called Spring Valley.<br/>
            For the past 24 years I have lived in Texas. I currently live in the town of Mission.<br/>
            I went to Junior College to be a chef but ended up very ill and unable to finish schooling.<br/>
            However, I worked as a chef at a hotel before I moved into retail.<br/>
            I have also worked at an Eco-dry cleaner as an asst general manager for a few years.<br/> 
            Currently I am a secretary for a local church.<br/>
            I am studying Spanish and studying web development.
